🧾 JG Wentworth – Florida Client Role Play Script
(Use “Justin Stedman” license reference until your own FL license is active.)

1) INTRODUCTION
“Hi [Client First Name], my name is [Your Name] with JG Wentworth.
Before we get started, this call is being recorded for quality and compliance purposes.
Do I have your permission to continue?”  ✅ (Box 1 – Recording disclosure)
“Great — and you’re located in Florida, correct?” ✅ (Box 2 – Confirm location)

2) DISCOVERY & CONNECTION
“Before we dive in, let me confirm a few details:
• First and last name
• Current address
• Last four digits of your social.”
“Perfect, thank you. You’re in Florida, right?”
“I understand you’ve been having a difficult time keeping up with more than the minimum payments
and you’re looking for a way to finally get ahead, right?
About how much do you still owe across credit cards and personal loans combined?”

3) FL DISCLOSURE (before credit pull)
“Before I review options, I’m required to share Florida disclosures:
• You may give notice of cancellation to us in writing within 7 business days after receipt of the confirmation.
• JG Wentworth’s policy allows you to cancel at any time and any unearned funds will be returned to you from your dedicated account.
• Commercial telephone seller license: TC5615
• Salesperson license: TP 108499
• Company address: 1200 Morris Drive, Chesterbrook, PA 19087
• Manager reference: Justin Stedman (until my FL license is active).”
“With your permission, I’ll pull a soft credit report — it won’t affect your score — so we can see what you qualify for. Is that okay?” ✅ (Boxes 3 & 4)

4) PROGRAM EXPLANATION
“Based on what I’m seeing, you may qualify for our Debt Relief Program.
It negotiates directly with creditors to reduce what you owe.”
“It will impact your credit in the short term because we stop minimum payments to enable negotiation.
Over time, clients typically see stability return as accounts resolve.” ✅ (Boxes 5 & 6)
“The decision to stop paying is your independent, conscious choice — we can’t make that decision for you.” ✅ (Box 7)

5) PROGRAM DETAILS & BUDGET
“Here’s what it looks like:
• Your monthly program deposit — not a payment — goes into an FDIC-insured dedicated account in your name.
• Settlements and fees are paid from that account as negotiated.
• The program fee in Florida is 29% of enrolled debt; term depends on your balances.
• Legal model: New Start Legal (coverage via Higbee Law) — do not select separate ‘legal plan’ in SF.” ✅ (Boxes 8–10)

6) NSL PARTNERSHIP LANGUAGE (read during Agreement Walkthrough)
“Now, let me tell you a bit more about how New Start Legal and JG Wentworth work together.
New Start Legal is a law firm that specializes in solutions for debt and defense.
Because of JG Wentworth’s reputation and success, New Start Legal chose us for administrative support and client service.
New Start Legal attorneys supervise our work, and all content we will discuss has been prepared by the law firm’s attorneys.
New Start Legal has a service fee of 29% of the balances enrolled, and it’s already built into your new monthly deposit of [$$ amount].
All debt reductions are reviewed by the law firm to ensure terms are in your best interest. New Start Legal is always here to assist you.”

7) FINAL DISCLOSURE / PART 8
“JG Wentworth works only with reputable, accredited programs.
Results vary based on your ability to make deposits.
You can cancel at any time, and any unearned funds will be returned to you.” ✅ (Box 11)

8) CLOSE / TRANSITION
“Based on your balances and budget, you’re approved to move forward.
I’ll email your agreement and walk through it with you now — it only takes a few minutes.
Once confirmed, Client Services will complete your Welcome Call in 24–72 hours and we’ll set your first deposit date.”`;

1) INTRODUCTION
“Hi [Client First Name], my name is [Your Name] with JG Wentworth.
This call is recorded for quality and compliance. Do I have your permission to continue?”
“Great — and you’re located in ${state}, correct?”

2) DISCOVERY & CONNECTION
“Before we dive in, please confirm:
• First & last name
• Current address
• Last four of SSN.”
“I understand you’ve been having a difficult time keeping up with more than minimum payments and want a path to get ahead.
About how much total unsecured debt are you trying to resolve?”

3) CREDIT PULL & EVALUATION
“We will review your information together to determine which of our products apply.
One option you may be eligible for is with New Start Legal, a law firm with attorney representation in your state.
Would you like to hear more details about how it works?”
“With your permission, I’ll run a SOFT credit pull (no score impact) to confirm all accounts. Is that okay?”

4) PROGRAM EXPLANATION (NSL Model)
“Through the NSL legal-model program:
• We negotiate directly with your creditors to reduce balances.
• You make a single monthly deposit into your FDIC-insured dedicated account.
• When settlements are reached, funds are released from your account to pay them.”
“This can temporarily impact credit because you are choosing to pause minimums to enable negotiation.
That choice must be your independent, conscious decision.”

5) COSTS & TERMS
“Program fee is 29% of enrolled debt (performance-based).
NSL legal services are included and supervised by licensed attorneys in your state.
Deposits and term are designed around your budget; you can accelerate anytime.”
